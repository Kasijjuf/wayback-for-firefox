= Wayback Machine for Firefox

This is a microscopic extension for Firefox, adding a button and a context menu item for interacting with https://archive.org[Archive.org]'s Wayback Machine service.

== Open In Wayback Machine Button
Clicking on a button opens the currently opened page in Wayback Machine. 

It is immensely useful in situations where you open a dead link and are presented with 404 "Not Found" or no host whatsoever. In such a case you can just click a button and see if Wayback Machine has crawled this link before.

== Wayback Machine Context Menu Item

Any link on a webpage can be opened directly in Wayback Machine.
This can be useful when you know beforehand that you are navigating to a dead link.
