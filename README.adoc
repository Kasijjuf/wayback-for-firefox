= Wayback Machine for Firefox

This is a microscopic extension for Firefox, adding a button and a context menu item for interacting with https://archive.org[Archive.org]'s Wayback Machine service.

== Open In Wayback Machine Button
Clicking on a button opens currently opened page in Wayback Machine. 

It is immensely useful when you open a dead link and is being presented by 404 "Not Found" orno host whatsoever: in such a case you can just click a button and look whether Wayback Machine crawled this link before.

== Wayback Machine Context Menu Item

Any link on the webpage can be opened directly in Wayback Machine.
It can be useful when you know beforehand that you are going to look at a dead link.
